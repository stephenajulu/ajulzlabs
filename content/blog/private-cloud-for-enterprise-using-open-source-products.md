Is it possible to build an affordable and compact private cloud for an enterprise based on open-source products? There is a prevalent opinion that this endeavor is either for the strong-willed or IT companies. Let's explore the feasibility of this approach.

Today, IT technologies are revolutionizing businesses across various industries. The demand for cloud solutions is growing rapidly due to their benefits, including scalability, rapid deployment, and swift adaptability to change. Many companies are attracted to the self-service model, seeking to create an IT infrastructure tailored to their specific needs. Open-source software becomes appealing in this context, offering a seemingly cost-effective solution. However, it's crucial to objectively evaluate the pros and cons of such implementations. Computing power has become increasingly affordable, both in terms of acquisition and ongoing operational costs. The range of available platforms is extensive, from systems with dozens of high-speed cores in compact, energy-efficient packages to those with hundreds of threads and terabytes of RAM in a single unit. Finding the optimal balance between performance and cost lies within this spectrum.


In some cases, commercially available solutions have become so cost-effective that they rival or surpass open-source-based solutions. For example, traditional storage systems using SSD/Flash and SATA from leading vendors are approaching the accessibility and efficiency of software-defined storage solutions. A small-scale commercial enterprise cloud solution may be comparable in initial acquisition cost and more cost-effective in the long run compared to open-source alternatives.
 Often, seemingly free resources can incur significant operational costs. Consider the scenarios involving backup and monitoring. Commercial solutions typically come with built-in tools that can enhance your existing methods, with the option to purchase additional capacity if needed. In contrast, implementing these functions using open-source solutions is feasible but may lead to escalating implementation and support costs over time.

A critical aspect to consider is the cost of network infrastructure. Regardless of the implementation approach, cloud infrastructures demand high-cost LAN/SAN networks. For small-scale solutions, low port utilization can result in a high ratio of equipment cost to overall solution cost, impacting the financial viability of the project.
 IT infrastructure can achieve similar goals through various methods, influenced by factors such as personal preferences, available technologies, established practices, and available resources. For instance, having a talented programmer, a near-perfect architectural solution, or some financial flexibility can provide additional degrees of freedom. The key is prioritizing your needs. If you're willing to allocate funds from commercial cloud licenses towards implementation, qualified technical support, and maintaining a continuously operational test environment for your open-source cloud system, there are no significant obstacles to building a private cloud using open source solutions.
