#### Managed Cloud
Our managed cloud services provide businesses with the flexibility and scalability of the cloud, while also ensuring the security and reliability of their data. We work with leading cloud providers including Google Cloud, AWS, and Microsoft Azure to deliver tailored cloud solutions that meet your specific business needs.

#### Backup and Disaster Recovery
In the event of a disaster (such as a flood, fire, or computer virus), would your important data remain safe and sound? If your business isn’t already following the 3-2-1 backup rule, the answer is probably no. This rule states that your data should be stored in three separate locations: the source device (likely a computer or office workstation), your local backup device, and an off-site location (preferably through a cloud backup solution). Following the 3-2-1 backup rule ensures that the probability of all three copies of your data being lost are slim to none.

We set this up for you following the 3-2-1 rule, ensuring a secure, permanent and trouble free backup and disaster recovery
